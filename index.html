              <h2>Visibility</h2>
              <p class="quote">"The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time." -- Nielsen</p>
              <p>When the University of Louisiana Lafayette website is accessed,  (<a href="http://louisiana.edu/">http://louisiana.edu/</a>), we are greeted by a homepage that has several salient elements positioned within two large rectangular panes that are situated side by side. The left most pane consists of a large university branded logo, followed by a column of 5 horizontal links (Prospective Students, Current Students, Alumni, Donors &amp; Friends, Visitors, Faculty &amp; Staff) and a vertical bar at the bottom of 4 links (Search, Index A-Z, Contact Us, ULink). The right most pane is largely made up of a dynamic picture box that shuffles through a gallery upon refresh and is also linked to via click. The bottom of this pane is comprised of an opaque box linking to a university research initiative page.
              </p>
              <p>
                Located above the two main panes is a navigational bar that has links to the following pages: news, about us, academics, student life, library, research, and athletics. Every subsequent page that is linked to has a banner under the navigation bar that is branded with the University logo and title of page, although there are a few exceptions. The library page (<a href="http://library.louisiana.edu">library.louisiana.edu</a>) and research page (<a href="http://research.ucs.louisiana.edu">research.ucs.louisiana.edu</a>) do not have a consistent layout with the original page. These links should be categorized elsewhere for visibility purposes, as they go against the standards set forth by the other navigational linked pages.
              <p>
                When clicking on any navigation bar link to go to a page, for example "about us", it fails to change the link to "active" which would have highlighted the current page. Instead, the site relies on a rectangular banner under the navigation bar, that matches the width of the proceeding page elements and displays the unique title of the current page. Although this gets the message of the current page across to the viewer, it does not come off as intuitively designed and user friendly unlike that of the “active” link scheme.

              <h2>Language</h2>
              <p class="quote">“The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.” --Nielsen</p>
              <p>
                The University of Louisiana website does a decent job to keep the language neutral and easy to understand. There is no required skill level or jargon to decipher other than basic terms and topics that revolve around education. It can be assumed that typical users are mostly prospective students, current students, or educated people seeking information so there should be nothing they wouldn’t be able to understand in terms of language. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Depending on the link you click and the user you are (e.g. prospective student, current student, graduate student, faculty), the language and tone differs. It takes on the user's point of view. This is important because prospective students might not know their way around the site whereas current students only look for certain features.

              <p class="quote">"Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo." --Nielsen</p>
              <p>
                There are no real animations or transactions found on the homepage or accompanying linked pages that can be seen. As far as control goes, the user is able to freely control where they go and what they read, despite the lack of fluidity.
              </p>
              <p>
                One glaring error is that the “library” and “research” page links, located in the navigation bar, lead to pages which have no directly visible/intuitive links back to the main University of Louisiana homepage. Clicking on the university logo on the library page yields no action and, in other words, is not “hot”. Upon further inspection, there is no link to be found on the library site that leads back to the university homepage-- a major problem for the user.
              </p>
              <p>
                The other pages incorporate an extra navigation bar on the top right corner of the page that have the link options of "Home", "Search", "Index A-Z", "Contact Us", and "ULink". The footers throughout the other pages linked via the navigation bar include a link back to the main homepage, with the exception of the “research” page.  Within the footer of the site are three links that lead to external websites for “Louisiana Board of Regents”, “University of Louisiana System”, and “Find UL on Youtube”. Clicking on any of these links forces the browser to open a new window without warning, effectively giving the user zero control or warning over this behavior.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another problem noticed on the library page is that it automatically connects you to a librarian via the embedded “Ask Reference” client. It is not obvious how to disconnect from the client and the user is not given an option to connect from the beginning but is forced to.

              <p>
                When clicking links from the main homepage, the text and background color of the entire navigation bar alternates, thus creating an unsavory visual effect. When clicking on any navigation bar link, the proceeding page fails to change to an "active" state, which would have highlighted the current page tab to distinguish it from others. It would be nice for the viewer to know where they were on the site just by looking at the navigation bar, even though it clearly states the page in the header.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you are on a navigation bar link page, another navigation link pops up above it displaying "Home, Search, Index a-z, Contact Us, Ulink".  On the home page, these links are placed under the University logo on the left half of the screen.  This is a major design inconsistency.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is inconsistent page design and layout throughout many links from the homepage. For example, following “current students”, we are taken to a page with a column of bolded topics that are further broken down into subtopic links. Clicking on various links will take you to very different university pages that display alternative stylistic properties and color schemes from that of the previous linked homepages. It is unconventional and chaotic to have these very different looking sub sites for such a dominant state university, essentially creating an impression of disorganization almost to the point of being unprofessional.

              <p class="quote">"Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action." --Nielsen</p>
              <p>
                When clicking the search button, a search page is loaded with a box to enter text into. Upon entering a query and pressing the search button, the page is refreshed with results stemming from a custom google search. The problem with this approach is that when no search results are found, the results page turns up blank and offers no help or alternatives to the viewer. If a simple misspelling is entered into the search field, there is no suggestion to correct the spelling and we are again given no results despite being powered by the google search engine. Searching for the same thing in the normal google search engine would offer spelling alternatives and thus is more effective than this custom google search embedded into the site. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, error prevention is necessary whenever a site is linking to an external or different portion of the site. In this case, there should be warnings before a user reaches the library and research pages because in either case, they cannot return to the main UofL page. See above links in Consistency to see this example.

This is a design inconsistency and can cause headaches for users who are simply trying to contact the University.

                The University of Louisiana site is not a good example of a flexible or efficient website. Just by navigating the website, the main flaw to be seen is that there are just way too many links on every page and a user must navigate through several levels of this to actually reach information. There is no site map link anywhere on the site. Once onto an information page, information is pretty sparse and not laid out well at all. Search is inconvenient because a user cannot use it directly on each page. Also, there is no easy way to provide feedback except for the web master’s email in the footer. 
              </p>
              <p>
                It would take a lot of work to re-design this website to be more efficient and flexible but the information flow and navigation would be a good place to start. I would also suggest to remove library and research from the top navigation bar since they are not important to navigating within the site. Instead, those should be links in a sidebar or links on the home page only. A user looking for information about the library or research would most likely not be a prospective student so there is no need to have that link in the main navigation.

                The University of Louisiana site looks very outdated, especially given that it’s 2012. The layout is very cluttered and information is generally hard to find with pages upon pages of mass text links. The homepage is outdated and even signifies this in the footer by stating “© Copyright 2003 by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette”. On a more positive note, the footer contained on most pages lists the address of the university in plain site, along with a main phone number and email address of the webmaster.
              </p>
              <p>
                The site in general seems like something out of the early days of the internet, with pixelated and low resolution images comprised of dull colors making up the main pages. There is a major lack in visual appeal when compared to more modern university websites. A whole website re-haul and redesign is desperately needed to keep up with current schools as this is a reflection of their overall image to the whole world and public at large.

                One thing the University of Louisiana website does right is offer suggestions to the viewer when accessing a broken page or URL. The suggestions are to recheck the spelling of the URL if inputted manually, contact the webmaster if a server error has occurred, or click on the three conveniently listed links to go back to the home page, site index, and site search. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Due to the lack of error prevention on external links, once a user gets out of the University of Louisiana site, they have no method for getting the user back to the home page. It would be wise for them to fix this aspect with regards to the library and research pages. They should either incorporate those pages or make it known on the home page that those are separate sites.

              <p>
                Since this is an informational site and not task-based, there is not much need for documentation. The only help this site provides is a web master email in the footer. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike the main page, the library page does have its own form of help. On the bottom left hand side, users have the option of chatting with a librarian if they have any questions regarding the library or books. This module is somewhat hidden at first when the page is loaded, so the user must scroll down and might not have known it was there at all. Since this feature actually connects you to a librarian in real time, it should be easy for the user to find this. A suggestion would be to list this service on the main page so that it is somewhat easier to locate. 
              </p>
              <p>
                For the main page, it would be nice for there to be a site map, since navigation is inefficient. It would help users to see the site hierarchy and go to a page much quicker then navigating through the mess of links to find what they are looking for.
